//About NUll-Pointer Exception
/*
NullPointerException is a RuntimeException. In Java, a special null value can be assigned to an object reference.
 NullPointerException is thrown when program attempts to use an object reference that has the null value.
        These can be:
        Invoking a method from a null object.
        Accessing or modifying a null objectâ€™s field.
        Taking the length of null, as if it were an array.
        Accessing or modifying the slots of null object, as if it were an array.
        Throwing null, as if it were a Throwable value.
        When you try to synchronize over a null object.
